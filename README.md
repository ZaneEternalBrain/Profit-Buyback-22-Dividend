# How ZANE Reshapes AI Investment Principles with "Profit Buyback + 22% Dividend"?

## 1. Token Distribution Mechanism to Ensure Long-Term Value

ZANE Token (ZANE) has a total supply of **1 billion**, with no further inflation and a permanent cap to guarantee scarcity. Its profit buyback mechanism and issuance model are designed to support long-term growth.

**Core Rules**:
- **Private Sale Lock-up**: 12-month lock-up, linearly released over the next 36 months.
- **Team Allocation (20%)**: 6-month lock-up, then released monthly over 60 months.
- **Ecosystem Reserve**: Locked for 3 years, to be used for ecological and commercial expansion.
- **Liquidity Incentives**: Gradually released based on transaction volumes.
- **Marketing & Branding**: Released according to project needs and platform visibility.
- **TGE Circulation (20%)**: For listings and exchange liquidity support.

As profits increase, token buybacks reduce market supply. Over time, this solidifies value and trust, establishing a new paradigm of long-term, growth-driven AI investment.

## 2. Profit Buyback Drives Token Growth

Every quarter, 50% of the platform's profits are used to buy back ZANE.  
- Half of the bought-back tokens are **burned permanently**  
- The other half are **redistributed as dividends**.

This model forms ZANEâ€™s **circular value system**, promoting a cycle of:

> "The more you use it, the more you benefit;  
> The more you benefit, the stronger the ecosystem."
